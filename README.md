# image-classifier
AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Project

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. 

The project is broken down into multiple steps:
1. Load and preprocess the image dataset
2. Train the image classifier on the dataset
3. Use the trained classifier to predict image content through a command line application
